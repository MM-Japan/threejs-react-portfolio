  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Max, a web developer passionate about creating interactive digital
    experiences. I have a background in film, having earned a <strong>Master's
    degree in Directing Film and Television</strong> in 2020, but I
    transitioned into web development to merge creativity with technology.

    I built <a href="www.chore-quest.com" target="_blank">ChoreQuest</a>, a
    gamified productivity app, and have strong skills in <strong>Ruby on Rails
    </strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>.

    Currently, I'm exploring <strong>Three.js</strong> to create immersive 3D
    web experiences.
    
    Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring Japan, ramen, and video games. I'm
    always learning and excited for new challenges ahead.
